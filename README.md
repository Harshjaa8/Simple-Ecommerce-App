ðŸ›’ Simple E-commerce App
This is a basic e-commerce web app I created using React. I mainly built it to practice component structuring, props handling, and adding interactivity using useState. It's a simple project but helped me a lot in understanding the core flow of a shopping UI.

ðŸ’¡ Features
Product listing with name and price

Live search filter for products

ðŸ“Œ Purpose
I built this app as a learning project to understand how real-world e-commerce platforms work at the frontend level. It helped me explore concepts like lifting state up, filtering arrays, and rendering dynamic UI.
